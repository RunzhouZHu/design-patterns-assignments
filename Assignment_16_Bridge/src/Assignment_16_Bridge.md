# Assignment 16: Bridge

> Runzhou ZHu

## 1. Introduction

Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern.
It decouples abstraction from implementation so that they can change independently.
The abstraction and the implementer could both be interface or abstract class.

Children of the abstraction can have different implementers. Since we can change the reference to the implementer in the abstraction, we are able to change the abstractionâ€™s implementer at run-time. Changes to the implementer do not affect client code.

I chose the Geeksforgeeks as the example implementation.
The line is: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bridge-design-pattern/

In the example, the abstraction is `Vehicle` and implementer is `Workshop`.
The refined abstraction - `Bike` or `Car` can have different (or the same) concrete implementations - `Assemble` and `Produce`.

When we change the method in `Assemble` or `Produce`, the `Bike` and `Car` class can still work normally.

## 2. New Functionality

I added a new vehicle - the `EV`, and 2 new workshops - the `AutomatedProduceLine` and `InstantChargeStation`.

I added this new functionality because the origin example in the website did include the case that different abstraction
could use different implementer. So I added the `AutomatedProduceLine` to put the `Assemble` and `Produce`
together and added a new implementer - the `InstantChargeStation`.

## 3. Implementation
```java
// AutomatedProduceLine.java

public class AutomatedProduceLine implements Workshop {
    Workshop produce = new Produce();
    Workshop assemble = new Assemble();

    @Override
    public void work() {
        produce.work();
        assemble.work();
    }
}
```

```java
// InstantChargeStation.java

public class InstantChargeStation implements Workshop {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Charged");
    }
}
```

```java
// EV.java

public class EV extends Vehicle {
    public EV(Workshop workshop1, Workshop workshop2) {
        super(workshop1, workshop2);
    }

    @Override
    public void manufacture() {
        System.out.println("EV");
        workshop1.work();
        workshop2.work();
    }
}
```
```java
// BridgePattern.java

public class BridgePattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle vehicle1 = new Car(new Produce(), new Assemble());
        vehicle1.manufacture();
        Vehicle vehicle2 = new Bike(new Produce(), new Assemble());
        vehicle2.manufacture();

        // new functionality
        Vehicle vehicle3 = new EV(new AutomatedProduceLine(), new InstantChargeStation());
        vehicle3.manufacture();
    }
}
```

## 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the customization of the example is completed and works fine.
I decide to merge the `Assemble` and `Produce` together and them work normally.
I could also create a new class instead of use the old two.
